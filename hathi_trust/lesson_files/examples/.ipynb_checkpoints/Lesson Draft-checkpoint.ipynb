    "## The Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "The **HathiTrust Research Center** (**HTRC**) is the research arm of the HathiTrust, tasked with supporting research usage of the works held by the HathiTrust. Particularly, this support involves mediating large-scale access to material in a non-consumptive manner, which aims to allow research over a work without enabling that work to be traditionally enjoyed or read by a human reader.  Huge digital collections can be of public benefit by allowing scholars to make insights about history and culture, and the non-consumptive model allows for these uses to be sought within the restrictions of intellectual property law.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of their mission, the HTRC has released the **Extracted Features** dataset, of features derived for every page of 4.8 million 'volumes' (a generalized term referring to the different types of materials in the HathiTrust collection, of which books are the most prevalent type).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a feature? A **feature** is a quantifiable marker of something measurable, a datum. A computer cannot understand the meaning of a sentence implicitly, but it can understand the counts of various words and word forms, or the presence or absence of stylistic markers, from which it can be trained to better understand text. In other words, in text analytics a feature is text converted to the language of the algorithm. A dataset of features can be non-consumptive, assuming there isn't enough information to reconstruct the book text from the features, but is also likely the exact same information a researcher would traditionally have to extract themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all features are useful, and not all algorithms use the same features. The HTRC Extracted Features Dataset includes information such as counts of word occurrences tagged by part of speech, line and sentence counts, and counts of characters at the leftmost and rightmost sides of a page. No positional information is provided, so the data does not specify if 'brown' was followed by 'dog', though the information is shared for every single page, so you can at least infer how often 'brown' and 'dog' occurred in the same general vicinity within a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "With easy access and features already extracted, the Extracted Features dataset offers a great entry point to programmatic text analysis and text mining. To further simplify beginner usage, the HTRC has released the HTRC Feature Reader. The **HTRC Feature Reader** scaffolds use of the dataset with the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial teaches the fundamentals of using the Extracted Features dataset with the HTRC Feature Reader. The Feature Reader is designed to make use of data structures from the most popular scientific tools in Python, so the skills taught here will apply to other settings of data analysis. In this way, the Extracted Features dataset is a particularly good use case, one useful to historians, for more general skills."

    "## Possibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Historians have access to a huge, century-spanning dataset in the HTRC Extracted Features dataset. It provides extracted textual information for each page in 4 million scanned books. This dataset is useful for the access it provides to the published word, but in having data pre-extracted, it also reduces the number of steps a scholar needs to take in text analysis, and makes research easier for others to reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it is relatively new, the Extracted Features dataset is already seeing use by scholars, as seen on a [page collected by the HTRC](https://wiki.htrc.illinois.edu/display/COM/Extracted+Features+in+the+Wild). [Mimno (2014)](http://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/wordsim/nearest.html) has processed word co-occurrence tables per year, allowing others to view how correlations between topics change over time. [Underwood (2015)](https://sharc.hathitrust.org/genre) has identified genre (fiction, poetry, drama) for 178k books and released genre-specific word counts, against which [Forster (2015)](http://cforster.com/2015/09/gender-in-hathitrust-dataset/) was able to study author gender by genre.\n",

    "## Suggested Prior Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson aims to provide a gentle but technical introduction to text analysis in Python with the HTRC Feature Reader. Most of the code is provided, but is most useful if you are comfortable tinkering with it and seeing how outputs change when you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend a baseline knowledge of Python conventions, which can be learned with Turkel and Crymble's [series of Python lessions](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/introduction-and-installation) on Programming Historian.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills taught here are focused on flexibly accessing and working with already-computed text features. For a better understanding of the process deriving word features, Programming Historian provides a lesson on [Counting Frequencies](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/counting-frequencies), by Turkel and Crymble."

    "\n",
    "For this lesson, you need to install the HTRC Feature Reader library for Python alongside the data science libraries that it depends on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing a Python distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The common way to install Python packages is using `pip`. If you have Python installed with pip, you can skip this section. However, if you don't know what `pip` is or if the dependencies are creating issues for you, you can avoid considerable hassle by using Anaconda.\n",

    "To install Anaconda, download the installer for your system from the [Anaconda download page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and follow their instructions for installation of either the Windows 64-bit Graphical Installer or the Mac OS X 64-bit Graphical Installer. You can choose either version of Python for this lesson. If you have followed earlier lessons on Python at the *Programming Historian*, you are using Python 2, but the HTRC Feature Reader also supports Python 3.\n",

Also, note that not all manual installations are alike because of hard-to-configure system optimizations. If you think your code is going slow, you should check that Numpy has access to [BLAS and LAPACK libraries](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19350234/233577) and install [Pandas recommended packages](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/install.html#recommended-dependencies).

An initialized FeatureReader can be iterated through with a `for` loop.

    "Generators are the key to working with lots of data. They allow you to iterate over a set of items that don't exist yet, preparing them only when it is their turn to be acted upon. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that there are 4.8 million volumes in the Extracted Features dataset. When coding at that scale, you need to be be mindful of two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't hold everything in memory: you can't. Use it, reduce it, and move on.\n",
    "2. Don't devote cycles to processing something before you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator simplifies such on-demand, short term usage. Think of it like a pizza shop making pizzas when a customer orders, versus one that prepares them beforehand. The traditional approach to iterating through data is akin to making *all* the pizzas for the day before opening. Doing so would make the buying process quicker, but also adds a huge upfront time cost, needs larger ovens, and necessitates the space to hold all the pizzas at once. An alternate approach is to make pizzas on-demand when customers buy them, allowing the pizza place to work with smaller capacities and without having pizzas laying around the shop. This is the type of approach that a generator allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumes need to be prepared before you do anything with them, being read, decompressed and parsed. This 'initialization' of a volume is done when you ask for the volume, *not* when you create the FeatureReader. In the above code, after you run `fr = FeatureReader(paths)`, there are are still no `Volume` objects held behind the scenes: just the pointers to the file locations. The files are only read when their time comes in the loop on the generator `fr.volumes()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you tried to read hundreds of volumes when the FeatureReader is initialized (as you can try, against our advice, with `list(fr.volumes())`, that command would take a very long time, and if you had a bug in later actions, the waiting would be for naught. With enough volumes, it is also likely that your system would run out of RAM, because all the volumes would be held in memory at the same time. Using the generator, Python assumes that you only need the volume within its turn in the loop: after moving on to the next volume in the iterator, the earlier one is thrown away. Because of this one-by-one reading, the items of a generator cannot be accessed out of order (e.g. you cannot ask for the third item of `fr.volumes()` without going through the first two first."

In pandas, however, you can name these, so instead of A, B, C, rows can be referred to by more descriptive names. You can also how multiple levels, so you're not bound by the two-dimensions of a table format. With a multiindexed DataFrame, you can ask for `Page=24,section=Body, ...`.\n",

    "Up to this point, the token count DataFrames have been subsetted, but not modified from the way they were returned by the HTRC Feature Reader. There are many cases where one may want to perform aggregation or transformation based on subsets of data. To do this, Pandas supports the 'split-apply-combine' pattern (**TODO cite Hadley W.**).\n",

    "Split-apply-combine processes are supported on DataFrames with `groupby()`, which tells Pandas to split by some criteria. From there, it is possible to apply some change to each group individually, after which Pandas combines the affected groups into a single DataFrame again.\n",

This means that rather than thinking into terms of rows, Pandas is now thinking of the `tl` DataFrame as a series of smaller groups, the groups selected by a common value for part of speech. So, all the personal pronouns (\"PRP\") are in one group, and all the adverbs (\"RB\") are in another, and so on.\n",
    "- *Apply* with `sum()`: These groups were sent to an apply function, `sum()`. Sum is an aggregation function, so it sums all the information in the 'count' column for each group. For example, all the rows of data in the adverb group are summed up into a single count of all adverbs. \n",

    "`sum()` is one of many convenient functions [built-in](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html) to Panadas. Other useful functions are `mean()`, `count()`, `max()`. It is also possible to send your groups to any function that you write with `apply()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> groupby can be used on data columns or an index. To run against an index, as above, use `levels=[index_level_name]` as above. To group against columns, use `by=[column_name]`.\n",

    "Below are some examples of grouping token counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find most common tokens in the entire volume (sorting by most to least occurrances)\n",
    "  - `tl.groupby(level=\"token\").sum().sort_values(\"count\", ascending=False)`\n",
    "- Count how many pages each token/pos combination occurs on\n",
    "  - `tl.groupby(level=[\"token\", \"pos\"]).count()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "Remember from earlier that certain information can be called by sending arguments to `vol.tokenlist()`, so you don't always have to do the grouping yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformations can also be done, where the process returns the same number of rows as the input groups, but changes based on some grouping. Here is an example of more advanced usage, a [TF\\*IDF](https://porganized.com/2016/03/09/term-weighting-for-humanists/) function:"

    "Now that you know the basics of the HTRC Feature Reader, you can learn more about the [Extracted Features dataset](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/features). The [Feature Reader home page](https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader/blob/master/README.ipynb) contains a lesson similar to this one but for more advanced users (that's you now!), and the [code documentation](http://htrc.github.io/htrc-feature-reader/htrc_features/feature_reader.m.html) gives exact information about what types of information can be called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underwood (2015) has released a [custom subset of the HTRC EF Dataset](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/genre), comprised of volumes classified by genre: fiction, poetry, and drama. Though many historians will be interested in other corners of the dataset, fiction is a good place to tinker with text mining ideas because of its expressiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the repository for the HTRC Feature Feature has [advanced tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader/tree/master/examples) showing how to use the library further. For example, one advanced tutorial shows how to [derive 'plot arcs' for a text](https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader/blob/master/examples/Within-Book%20Sentiment%20Trends.ipynb), a process popularized by Jockers (2015).\n",

    "# Appendix: Downloading custom files via rsync\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTRC Extracted Features (EF) dataset is accessible using *rsync*, a Unix command line program for syncing files. It is already preinstalled on Linux or Mac OS. Windows users need to use *rsync* by downloading a program such as [https://cygwin.com/](Cygwin), which provides a Unix-like command line environment in Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To download all *1.3 TB* comprising the EF dataset, you can use this command (be aware the full transfer will take a very long time):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rsync -rv data.sharc.hathitrust.org::pd-features/basic/ .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " This recurses (the `-r` flag) through all the folders on the HTRC server, and syncs all the files to a location on your system in this case a `.` meaning \"the current folder\"). The `-v` flag means `--verbose`, which simply gives you more information.\n",
    " You can also sync individual files by inputing a full file path. A list of all file paths is available: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rsync -azv data.sharc.hathitrust.org::pd-features/listing/pd-basic-file-listing.txt .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " It is also possible to sync a subset of files defined in a text file. The Feature Reader Library [has a document describing steps to compile such a list](https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader/blob/master/examples/ID_to_Rsync_Link.ipynb)."
