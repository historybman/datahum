    "## Homework 3: Functions and Hypothesis-Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework begins by reviewing some things we accomplished in class, and defining some functions. Then it asks you to apply those functions to the Bechdel dataset. We won't fully replicate the data analysis performed in [the Bechdel article,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/) and spelled out (using R) in [this online analysis.](https://mran.microsoft.com/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/bechdel.html) But we're going to build some elements of the process from the ground up, so that we genuinely understand what's going on â€” especially where hypothesis testing is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should say up front that the approach we're taking to hypothesis-testing here is only one of several possible approaches; it's based on what statisticians call a *frequentist* theory of statistics. *Bayesian* statistics provide an alternative way of reasoning about these questions; we'll glance at that in a couple of weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, let's test the significance of a correlation. We saw in class that movies that fail to pass the Bechdel test have lower median return-on-investment than those that do pass. This hints that movie studios may be controlled by a kind of sexism that is not only unjust, and not only not profitable, but actually self-destructive and money-*losing.* \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, I mentioned in class that there's a potential *confounding variable* in this argument. Movies with lower budgets generally have higher ROI. So perhaps movies that pass the Bechdel test have higher ROI simply *because* they have lower budgets? We won't completely resolve that question below, but we'll build up to it. To begin with, is the relationship between budget and return-on-investment actually meaningful, or would we be likely to see relations of that kind emerge by chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "To test that, we'll start by reconstructing the functions we need for a correlation test."

    "I am not sure how to interpret the results of this test.  I think I understand the concept of testing to see whether the difference between the medians of the two groups, i.e. the pass group and the fail group, is actually significant, or whether the difference in the median between these two groups is insignificant.  In this case, the p-value is clearly < .05, suggesting that we reject the null.  But that's about as far as I can get reading the online articles about this statistical test.  "

    "How much can we infer? This article seems to suggest that we can infer that the films that pass the bechdel test earn more per dollar spent than those that fail it. The problem is that the confounding factors (for instance budget) cannot be ruled out.  One thing that this article does is look for correlations by using the logarithmic expression of the parameters under investigation. What this does is to enhance the differences between values which otherwise would be bunched up on the chart because of the spread of values and the existence of some values at the high extremes.  But as for the results of these analyses, it is mixed. It seems clear that there is a significant correlation between cost of movies and international return on investment, although a contrary finding is that higher budgets seem to correlate with lower ROI overall.  And given the uncertainty of correlation between those variables, we are inclined then to think that the bechdel passing movies are indeed earning more than the failing movies in a significant way.
