    "# Homework 4: Applying Dunning's log-likelihood to 19c poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "I've put my \"solutions\" to in-class exercises on the Moodle, except for Exercise 2, which has become our homework assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find 25 words that are overrepresented in poetry reviewed by elite 19c magazines, as compared to other works of poetry that didn't get reviewed in those venues. Also list 25 words that are overrepresented in poetry that didn't get reviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you'll need to copy over some of the functions from our Week 4 exercises, and also copy over the code from our in-class Exercise #1, editing it so that it divides the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some code to get us started. I load some modules we're likely to need, and then load the ```poefic``` corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I filter the ```poefic``` DataFrame to have only poetry. I'm doing this for two reasons. The first is that I'm a little concerned that the size of the data is posing a problem on some computers. The other, more immediate, reason is that this dataset only has an even distribution of the \"reception\" variable in poetry. (Almost all the fiction I gave you was reviewed in elite venues.)"
