I'll also create a \"dummy\" numeric column to represent the \"class\" each tweet belongs to, using the technique illustrated by Kevin Markham's linear regression notebook.\n"

It's pretty clear what a function like MultinomialNB() does, but it's not so clear what is happening under the hood. Obviously Ted's code from last week let me see what the Naive Bayes is actually calculating, so that's good at least.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the big problem here is that I'm not clear on what the output of the cross_val is. I think these are measurements of how successful the Bayes method was at classifying the tweets into trump and not-trump. That said, I think the most important piece of the Bayes is the actual model, which I take to be stored in the variable mnb. In the from-scratch Bayes functions that Ted coded last week, we were able to see the model, which was a dataframe with the various coefficients, especially the log_pos and log_neg which were what we used to test the model against the test set. Here in the scikit-learn environment, we no longer have this model and I'm confused about what is happening now. I'm not even sure I understand what that array is. \n",

    "A couple other questions:\n",
    "- Ted went to great lengths to turn the matrix from CountVectorizer() into a regular dataframe. However it looks above like he turns it back into a matrix ['termdoc.as_matric()] in order to pass it into the cross_val_score. Why not just leave it as a matrix?\n",
    "- What is mnb?"

    "\n",
    "I won't fully explain logistic regression here. I hope I have time to sketch a little on the whiteboard. But very briefly, it's a way of *mapping* linear regression onto a finite space between 0 and 1. This allows a regression algorithm to do the work of classification. It is sometimes more accurate than naive Bayes. (More importantly, it produces well-*calibrated* probabilistic predictions. When logistic regression tells you an instance has a 60% chance of being in class X, that number is actually meaningful. Naive Bayes, on the other hand, has a tendency to exaggerate, seeing instances as all the way toward one class or the other.) \n",
    "\n",
    "*Regularizing* the regression basically means adding a degree of deliberate fuzz to prevent overfitting. This is done by penalizing large weights in the model (so your decision boundary can't become all volatile and wiggly.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot of all this is that regularized logistic regression gives you a parameter to tune: the regularization constant, ```C```, controlling the degree of fuzziness. In the scikit-learn implementation, small values of ```C``` mean strong (fuzzy) regularization.\n",

    "I am sure I could have done this much more efficiently and without a bunch of the lines that I wrote; indeed, I think this is pretty un-Pythonic. I would not be too surprised if I did it wrong, in fact. At the same time, the numbers look okay. I still need to get the intuition of the Bayes down. Maybe one thing we could discuss is how you've used this in your work, a real-life example. The examples you gave the other day about biography vs. fiction might help me to understand the use of the model. Is the idea that you run the log regression or the bayes model on corpuses from different points in time, and then see how the model performs for any given time? Do you use the same model while comparing mid 19th century to early 20th century corpuses, or do you re-run the functions? These kinds of intuitions are still not totally clear to me. Thanks Ted!"
