    "\n",
    "I won't fully explain logistic regression here. I hope I have time to sketch a little on the whiteboard. But very briefly, it's a way of *mapping* linear regression onto a finite space between 0 and 1. This allows a regression algorithm to do the work of classification. It is sometimes more accurate than naive Bayes. (More importantly, it produces well-*calibrated* probabilistic predictions. When logistic regression tells you an instance has a 60% chance of being in class X, that number is actually meaningful. Naive Bayes, on the other hand, has a tendency to exaggerate, seeing instances as all the way toward one class or the other.) \n",
